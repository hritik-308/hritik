Pseudo code
take a list as a input which we have to sort
take a variable which contain the len the of the list
take a blank list
initialize the value of the index
use while loop to check the every number im the list 
using min we use to retirive the  minimum value of the list
then append its suceeding minimum value
delete minimum from the list and save the deleted element to the blank list
then print the new list we will get the sorted array













a     = [12,0,39,50,1]   
kk    = len(a)
new_a = []
i     = 0

while i < kk:
    xx = min(a)      
    new_a.append(xx) 
    a.remove(xx)     
    i += 1           
print(new_a)
